# unsupervised_learning

This projects goal is to analyze cyrptocurrncy pricing at various intervals.  Doing so will
result in understanding patterns that arise across frequencies and across coins.

The analysis uses KMeans and PCA as it unsupervised learning tools.  The elbow methodology is employed in order
to see the optimal number of clusters to use for the analysis.  In addtion, the data are scaled using StandardScaler.
